# Background
Driven by a quest to navigate the data analyst job market more effectively, this project was born from a desire to pinpoint top-paid and in-demand skills, streamlining others work to find optimal jobs. 
My 
Data hails from my [SQL Course] (https://lukebarousse.com/sql). It's packed with insights on job titles, salaries, locations, and essential skills. 
### The questions i wanted to answer through my sql queries were
1. What are the top-paying data analyst jobs? 
2. What skills are required for these top-paying jobs? 
3. What skills are most in demand for data analysts? 
4. Which skills are associated with higher salaries? 
5. What are the most optimal skills to learn?
 
# Tools I Used
For my deep dive into the data analyst job market, I harnessed the power of several key tools: 

**SQL**: The backbone of my analysis, allowing me to query the database and unearth critical insights. 
**PostgreSQL**: The chosen database management system, ideal for handling the job posting data. 
**Visual Studio Code**: My go-to for database management and executing SQL queries. 
**Git & GitHub**: Essential for version control and 
sharing my SQL scripts and analysis, ensuring collaboration and project tracking.
